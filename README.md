# be-considerate 
I am constantly forgetting to send well wishes during important holidays and events to the right people on the right days. This makes it easier. Give it the person, dates, and a phrase to send out, and it will remember to tell that person on the right day! You'll look like a super considerate and thoughtful person.

It's no fun when your memory stinks and you are constantly reminded by others how you forget important dates. Sometimes, you are away from your phone or computer during the day and aren't able to get the well wishes out. 

This project is interesting because I get to play with text messaging and randomization in relation to emoticons and strings.

Feel free to fork/submit pull requests! I'll try to provide support to this, but it's a pet project mostly for fun.
